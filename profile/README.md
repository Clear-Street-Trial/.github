Markets, simplified.
Our cloud-native platform gives institutions better access to markets.

#### Single-source platform
## Building modern infrastructure


Old infrastructure makes markets difficult and expensive to access. We're fixing that.
 
We started with prime brokerage, an industry that has struggled to see any real innovation in decades. Our tech-first platform has redefined what it means to work with a prime broker - access, speed, and service for our clients.
 
We want to continue that change across all capital markets, for every type of investor - institutions, active traders, market-makers, and fintech apps.


#### Infrastructure
## Close to the metal

Our platform is built directly on the ground floor of capital markets. Weâ€™re integrated with central clearing houses and exchanges. Weâ€™ve agonized about our data model abstractions, created horizontal scalability, and crafted thoughtful APIs. All so we can create better product experiences.

## Why Clear Street

#### A technology-first approach to capital markets
Access granted
Access to data should be fast, reliable, and instant. It shouldn't be inaccessible due to overnight batch processing. Our full service platform allows clients to access their data in real-time, without having to wait until the next day.

#### Built for speed
Markets are moving faster than ever. Infrastructure needs to move with it. We make around 6,000 updates to our platform each year and are constantly refining our processes to help you move with todayâ€™s fast-paced markets.

#### Proactive service
High tech meets high touch. Open an account and start trading in days, not months. Thanks to our cloud-based technology, it only takes 14 days to onboard an institutional client.
